## Introduction

As more companies are migrating their workloads to cloud systems, it seems imperative to learn the new resources.  Since I come from a predominantly Microsoft background, learning PowerShell, ActiveDirectory, and Windows Server, it seems natural to me to, shed the VMware knowledge and learn a new platform.   Therefore, I have decided to learn Microsoft's Azure platform and offerings.

### Goals

My goal is to gain the [Microsoft Azure AZ-104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/?practice-assessment-type=certification) certification by ~~June 30th, 2025~~ December 31st, 2025.   I will study ~~over the course of 15 weeks of studying with June~~ for however long it takes, planning to take the test in December being my time to refresh and prepare to ace the test.   Every weekday, I will spend 1 hour studying a new topic in each of the 6 domains of the AZ-104 test.

### Study Material

I will be using the [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/) curriculum to prepare.

#### Why not use Udemy or YouTube

Why don't I use Udemy, YouTube, or any of the other 3rd party training companies?   Absolutely nothing is wrong with those platforms.  In my opinion, they are terrific for learning subjects that are more theoretical or skills that do not change as rapidly as Microsoft's Azure or Amazon's AWS.   College courses, Udemy, and YouTube are great snapshots in time of particular skills and there are many great content creators on those platforms.

Want to learn Linux?  Might I suggest [LearnLinux.tv](https://learnlinux.tv) where Jay has complete Linux courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jay-lacroix-3/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnLinuxTV).   Need more breadth of IT topics and not just Linux?  How about Lawrence Systems on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@LAWRENCESYSTEMS)?   Note: These links are not sponsor links and I do not receive any compensation in anyway from these guys.  They don't know me at all.

#### Why not AWS, GCP, or any of those other clouds?

Why am I sticking with Microsoft's Azure cloud offerings?   Like I said earlier, I come from a Microsoft background, and it only seems natural to use Microsoft's cloud offering.   Maybe some day we'll discover Amazon's AWS or Google's Cloud Platform or any of those other cloud platforms, but, for now, we are just going to be focusing on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.

### Snap, Snap...FOCUS - AZ-104

Oh...right.  I get distracted and go on tangents.

#### The Plan

Every day, I plan on making a blog post containing what I learned for that day.   It will not be as extensive as Microsoft Learn's material, but will be using it more for study notes and tying pieces together as we go through these different domains such as User Governance, Virtual Machines, Networking, and Storage Accounts.

Some posts will contain snippets of PowerShell, some Azure CLI, some Bash (for you Linux folks), some Bicep code, and some will have no code at all.  I will show different applications (VSCode, PowerShell, and Azure Storage Explorer), install and usage.

I will be referencing the pages that I am studying that day and will share my posts on social media, mainly [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jkeithbaldwin/), [X](https://twitter.com/TheRealNerdyDad) (formerly known as Twitter), and on [GitHub](https://github.com/TheRealNerdyDad).   These posts will have the hashtag #75daysToAZ104 with what day we're in of the 75 days to help track my progress, taking weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) off for rest.

#### Post-AZ-104

After the AZ-104?   Not sure yet.  Maybe focusing on more computing, such as AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services) or Docker on Azure?   Maybe on Azure Services, such as Azure SQL ([DP-300](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-database-administrator-associate/?practice-assessment-type=certification)?) or Azure File Services.  Not sure yet.   Let's see what the comments have to say along the way.

## Finally

I already look forward to your comments and any tips and tricks tha you may have for me in regards to either studying and preparing for this test or the little helps that you may have concerning Microsoft Azure and the AZ-104 test.
