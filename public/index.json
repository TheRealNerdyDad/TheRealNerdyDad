How about we start with the basics and answer the following 2 questions in this post:\nWhat is Azure? How do we interact with Azure? What is Azure? # Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure is a cloud platform that provides compute, storage, and networking resources to build cloud-hosted applications. These resources can span across many different resources, such as full Virtual Machines (VMs), containers, or cloud-native apps; additional virtual disks for virtual machines, file servers as a service, or SQL as a service; or VPN gateways, networking groups, or load balancers. There are many choices, but what determines what resources you will use depends on what you are trying to accomplish.\nTools At Hand # Now that we know Azure is, how do we interact with it to create, utilize, and administer these resources? That depends on what you are comfortable with and what you need to accomplish.\nThere are 4 tools that allows you to administer Azure resources:\nAzure Portal Azure PowerShell and/or Azure CLI Azure Cloud Shell Azure Mobile App Azure Portal # The Azure Portal is probably going to be the tool that you use the most. It is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) typically used to carry out single tasks or to dig deeper into details of a resource or logs. It can also be used to create resources through step-by-step procedures. However, the Azure Portal does not natively allow you to automate repetitive tasks, such as creating multiple VMs. The Azure Portal can be accessed from any modern, internet-connected web browser.\nAzure PowerShell \u0026amp; Azure CLI # Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI are 2 tools that accomplish the same task. Depending on your background will determine which tool you grow more accustomed to. Both tools allows you to automate repetitive tasks through scripts.\nAzure PowerShell # PowerShell natively comes from Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Windows Servers, ever since Windows Server 2003 SP1 with version 1.0. Today, non-Azure PowerShell is at version 7.5. PowerShell utilizes a Verb-Noun naming convention for its commands so that it is easier to understand what is happening in either the command line or in scripts.\nNew-AzVM -ResourceGroupName \u0026#34;MyResourceGroup\u0026#34; -Name \u0026#34;TestVm\u0026#34; -Image \u0026#34;UbuntuLTS\u0026#34; Azure PowerShell is simply regular PowerShell with the Azure modules always updated and included in your session, if you are accessing Azure PowerShell from an Azure Cloud Shell session. Azure PowerShell is a better tool in comparison to the Azure Portal for either more complex tasks with either the Command Line Interface (CLI) or through a PowerShell script (*.ps1 file format) or for automated/repetitive tasks through a PowerShell script. It is more utilized by administrators with a Windows background for managing Azure resources as an iterative programming language, usually with some type of source control system, such as Git with GitHub, GitLab, or Azure Repositories.\nAzure PowerShell can be utilized directly on your computer (Windows, MacOS, or Linux), if you already have PowerShell installed and the Azure module imported.\nAzure CLI # Azure CLI is another option for Azure administrators that are coming from a Linux background is Azure CLI because has a different approach compared to Azure PowerShell. The biggest difference between Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell is that Azure CLI utilizes commands and syntax that is similar to Linux\u0026rsquo;s BASH shell and scripting.\naz vm create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name TestVm --image Ubuntu2204 --generate-ssh-keys Both Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell are cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, and Linux), and can be utilized through an interactive shell or through a script to automate repetitive or complex commands.\nAzure Cloud Shell # Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, browser-accessible shell used for managing Azure resources utilizing either Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI. You must authenticate prior to using Azure Cloud Shell.\nYou can use Azure Cloud Shell either at https://shell.azure.com or through the Azure Mobile App, which is coming up next.\nAzure Mobile App # Azure Mobile App is a mobile app tha can be installed on either iOS or Android and is used by the Azure administrator that is away from their computer but still able to manage and monitor their Azure resources.\nSome of the features that the Azure Mobile App includes is:\nChecking the status and critical metrics of important resources and services Receive alerts concerning health issues of important resources and services Review the latest service issues and outages from the Azure platform The ability to Shutdown, Reboot, or Start VMs or web apps The ability to connect to the VM Manage permissions to resources based on the end user\u0026rsquo;s role Access to the Azure Cloud Shell, as previously mentioned Conclusion # There are many tools and resources available at our disposal to use Azure. The question is, what best suits you for how you work? Is it going to be the Azure Portal with point-and-click functionality? Is it going to be with Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI? Or are you constantly on the go, utilizing the Azure Mobile App?\n","date":"July 28, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/getting-started---basics-and-tools/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Getting Started - Basics and Tools","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"July 28, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/module-1---prerequisites-for-azure-administrators/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Module 1 - Prerequisites for Azure Administrators","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"July 28, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/powershell/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Powershell","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"July 28, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Introduction # As more companies are migrating their workloads to cloud systems, it seems imperative to learn the new resources. Since I come from a predominantly Microsoft background, learning PowerShell, ActiveDirectory, and Windows Server, it seems natural to me to, shed the VMware knowledge and learn a new platform. Therefore, I have decided to learn Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure platform and offerings.\nGoals # My goal is to gain the Microsoft Azure AZ-104 certification by June 30th, 2025 December 31st, 2025. I will study over the course of 15 weeks of studying with June for however long it takes, planning to take the test in December being my time to refresh and prepare to ace the test. Every weekday, I will spend 1 hour studying a new topic in each of the 6 domains of the AZ-104 test.\nStudy Material # I will be using the Microsoft Learn curriculum to prepare.\nWhy not use Udemy or YouTube # Why don\u0026rsquo;t I use Udemy, YouTube, or any of the other 3rd party training companies? Absolutely nothing is wrong with those platforms. In my opinion, they are terrific for learning subjects that are more theoretical or skills that do not change as rapidly as Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure or Amazon\u0026rsquo;s AWS. College courses, Udemy, and YouTube are great snapshots in time of particular skills and there are many great content creators on those platforms.\nWant to learn Linux? Might I suggest LearnLinux.tv where Jay has complete Linux courses on Udemy and YouTube. Need more breadth of IT topics and not just Linux? How about Lawrence Systems on YouTube? Note: These links are not sponsor links and I do not receive any compensation in anyway from these guys. They don\u0026rsquo;t know me at all.\nWhy not AWS, GCP, or any of those other clouds? # Why am I sticking with Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure cloud offerings? Like I said earlier, I come from a Microsoft background, and it only seems natural to use Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s cloud offering. Maybe some day we\u0026rsquo;ll discover Amazon\u0026rsquo;s AWS or Google\u0026rsquo;s Cloud Platform or any of those other cloud platforms, but, for now, we are just going to be focusing on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure cloud platform.\nSnap, Snap\u0026hellip;FOCUS - AZ-104 # Oh\u0026hellip;right. I get distracted and go on tangents.\nThe Plan # Every day, I plan on making a blog post containing what I learned for that day. It will not be as extensive as Microsoft Learn\u0026rsquo;s material, but will be using it more for study notes and tying pieces together as we go through these different domains such as User Governance, Virtual Machines, Networking, and Storage Accounts.\nSome posts will contain snippets of PowerShell, some Azure CLI, some Bash (for you Linux folks), some Bicep code, and some will have no code at all. I will show different applications (VSCode, PowerShell, and Azure Storage Explorer), install and usage.\nI will be referencing the pages that I am studying that day and will share my posts on social media, mainly LinkedIn, X (formerly known as Twitter), and on GitHub. These posts will have the hashtag #75daysToAZ104 with what day we\u0026rsquo;re in of the 75 days to help track my progress, taking weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) off for rest.\nPost-AZ-104 # After the AZ-104? Not sure yet. Maybe focusing on more computing, such as AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services) or Docker on Azure? Maybe on Azure Services, such as Azure SQL (DP-300?) or Azure File Services. Not sure yet. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what the comments have to say along the way.\nFinally # I already look forward to your comments and any tips and tricks tha you may have for me in regards to either studying and preparing for this test or the little helps that you may have concerning Microsoft Azure and the AZ-104 test.\nDisclaimer # I am in no way affiliated with the Microsoft Corporation or any of it\u0026rsquo;s subsidiaries in any financial or contractual obligations. I am just another IT guy learning new skills as the world around me continues to change. Any opinion and views are of myself and do not reflect that of my employer or Microsoft.\n","date":"February 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-02-23---post-0---the-setup/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Post 0 - The setup","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
