Since I come from a predominantly Microsoft background, learning PowerShell, ActiveDirectory, and Windows Server, it seems natural to me to, shed the VMware knowledge and learn a new platform. Therefore, I have decided to learn Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure platform and offerings.\nGoals # My goal is to gain the Microsoft Azure AZ-104 certification by June 30th, 2025 December 31st, 2025. I will study over the course of 15 weeks of studying with June for however long it takes, planning to take the test in December being my time to refresh and prepare to ace the test. Every weekday, I will spend 1 hour studying a new topic in each of the 6 domains of the AZ-104 test.\nStudy Material # I will be using the Microsoft Learn curriculum to prepare.\nWhy not use Udemy or YouTube # Why don\u0026rsquo;t I use Udemy, YouTube, or any of the other 3rd party training companies? Absolutely nothing is wrong with those platforms. In my opinion, they are terrific for learning subjects that are more theoretical or skills that do not change as rapidly as Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure or Amazon\u0026rsquo;s AWS. College courses, Udemy, and YouTube are great snapshots in time of particular skills and there are many great content creators on those platforms.\nWant to learn Linux? Might I suggest LearnLinux.tv where Jay has complete Linux courses on Udemy and YouTube. Need more breadth of IT topics and not just Linux? How about Lawrence Systems on YouTube? Note: These links are not sponsor links and I do not receive any compensation in anyway from these guys. They don\u0026rsquo;t know me at all.\nWhy not AWS, GCP, or any of those other clouds? # Why am I sticking with Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure cloud offerings? Like I said earlier, I come from a Microsoft background, and it only seems natural to use Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s cloud offering. Maybe some day we\u0026rsquo;ll discover Amazon\u0026rsquo;s AWS or Google\u0026rsquo;s Cloud Platform or any of those other cloud platforms, but, for now, we are just going to be focusing on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Azure cloud platform.\nSnap, Snap\u0026hellip;FOCUS - AZ-104 # Oh\u0026hellip;right. I get distracted and go on tangents.\nThe Plan # Every day, I plan on making a blog post containing what I learned for that day. It will not be as extensive as Microsoft Learn\u0026rsquo;s material, but will be using it more for study notes and tying pieces together as we go through these different domains such as User Governance, Virtual Machines, Networking, and Storage Accounts.\nSome posts will contain snippets of PowerShell, some Azure CLI, some Bash (for you Linux folks), some Bicep code, and some will have no code at all. I will show different applications (VSCode, PowerShell, and Azure Storage Explorer), install and usage.\nI will be referencing the pages that I am studying that day and will share my posts on social media, mainly LinkedIn, X (formerly known as Twitter), and on GitHub. These posts will have the hashtag #75daysToAZ104 with what day we\u0026rsquo;re in of the 75 days to help track my progress, taking weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) off for rest.\nPost-AZ-104 # After the AZ-104? Not sure yet. Maybe focusing on more computing, such as AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services) or Docker on Azure? Maybe on Azure Services, such as Azure SQL (DP-300?) or Azure File Services. Not sure yet. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what the comments have to say along the way.\nFinally # I already look forward to your comments and any tips and tricks tha you may have for me in regards to either studying and preparing for this test or the little helps that you may have concerning Microsoft Azure and the AZ-104 test.\nDisclaimer # I am in no way affiliated with the Microsoft Corporation or any of it\u0026rsquo;s subsidiaries in any financial or contractual obligations. I am just another IT guy learning new skills as the world around me continues to change. Any opinion and views are of myself and do not reflect that of my employer or Microsoft.\n","date":"February 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/2025-02-23_post-0_the-setup/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Post 0 - The setup","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"February 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"February 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"February 22, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Welcome to NerdyDad.me","summary":"","title":"Welcome to NerdyDad.me","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/75/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"75","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/75da/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"75da","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/75daystoaz/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"75DaysToAZ","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
